Rock-i is a computer made of a rock, contcrete and love. Inside it is a raspberry pi zero and and I2S dac sound card, wrapped in a bit of bathroom silicone and connected to a small speaker, a 4'' gpio screen and a big red button. 

It is setup to run [space window](LINK TO SPACE WINDOW README) software and it will stream videos, play music, show your photos and more.

It is very beautiful.
